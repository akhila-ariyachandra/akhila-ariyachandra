### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Akhila Ariyachandra and Iâ€™m a web developer from Sri Lanka.

I discovered my love for JavaScript related development when I had to create a Node.js API has part of my final year project at university.

I first started learning React through developing a React Native app in my first job.

Now Iâ€™m just trying to continue my pursuit in learning more about JavaScript, React and Web Development through things like Next.js, Gatsby.js and GraphQL, and share what Iâ€™ve learned.
